  <p>Who Am I?</p>
<ul>
<li>Moving to the United States at the age of 18 and not having any solid foundation to land on, had taught me to count on myself and to work twice as hard towards my dreams.<br /><br /></li>
<li>that is why at the age of 20 while I was still in college, I was able to establish my own business that helped support me and gave me the financial independence to complete my education.</li>
<li>I am self-taught person, I managed to learn on my own web designing, HTML, Flash, and a little bit of JavaScript.<br /><br /></li>
<li>I am looking forward to conquering the Data Science industry as my ongoing interest had only been growing.</li>
