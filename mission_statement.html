  <p>Who Am I?</p>
  <p>Moving to the United States at the age of 18 and not having any solid foundation to land on, had taught me to only depends on myself and to work hard towards any dream I seek.<br /><br />that is why at the age of 20 I was able to establish my export business that helped support me and aided me in paying to complete my education at the time.</p>
  <p>I am self-taught, I taught myself web designing, HTML, Flash, and a little bit of JavaScript.</p>
  <p>I am looking forward in conquering the Data Science industry as my ongoing interest had only been growing and growing.</p>
